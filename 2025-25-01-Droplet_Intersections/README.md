# Intersections interview homework

Alright! This is a project I did for an interview take-home assignment.

Between the options of a spellchecker cli tool and a simulated intersection, I am going with the latter. I've spent a lot of time stuck in traffic thinking about traffic control systems, and I think it would be fun.

## The Planâ„¢

Because this project has quickly creeped up in scope in my head, I'm writing down a list of stuff I'm thinking about beforehand. It gives me a list to work down.

This will be a project using the HTML5 canvas for the UI, because it's a pretty easy API to use for displaying stuff in the browser, and super easy to run.

Features I'm shooting for:
- Two different types of control systems:
    - Dynamic (meaning there are sensors in the ground) [CHECK]
    - Time based
- Two different traffic patterns:
    - Random [CHECK]
    - E/W heavy (like side streets turning on to a highway) [CHECK]
    - Maybe a super even round robin? Not the most interesting, so maybe not. [CHECK]
- Manual controls for adding cars to lanes
- Fun UI elements instead of probably a text based skeleton. I want cars to be shown turning! Fancy looking traffic lights! Maybe even sprites!
- A "historical" toggle for each of the control systems to _supplement_ the control system with historical traffic data, allowing for changes on the fly.

To do all of this in a way that is sane given the scope creep and the time frame, we need to make some assumptions.

Assumptions and asterisks:
- We are assuming that this is a very isolated intersection. If one of the roads was coming off from a high throughput road like a freeway, that would *vastly* affect the system designed.
- We will not be handling emergency vehicles in our simulation
- We will not be handling large semi trucks in our simulation
- Normally a traffic study would be used to determine how an intersection should work. I'm gonna just be fiddling with values until I like it. Like how long the yellow light is on for is going to be different depending on the speed limit of the road.
- This is a simulation! The real world is awfully wiggly, and we're going to assume a variety of things that are less consistent IRL:
    - People don't stop in the intersection blocking traffic.
    - Similarly, we won't be simulating crashes. At least not until I get to the visual cars moving around where that will be easier. It shouldn't happen anyways.
    - Traffic cannot back up to this intersection
    - The sensors are perfect, and will never give false positive/negative results
    - If I get to the historical data toggle, the sensors can totally sense a car whipping by at 55mph to record that.


## The Results!

Alright, so it's been a few hours! Due to time constraints, I'm not gonna do much more.

Heres what's done:

- We have a UI for the lanes, the lights, the sensors, and a count of cars on each side.
- All the different traffic patterns, since they were pretty easy
- Several knobs to turn
- HTML inputs to turn some of those knobs
- Modular funcs to handle traffic light changes
- A traffic control queue, so we can queue up multiple traffic changes at once
- An approximation of accelaration and breaking for our cars on different light states

I of course didn't get to everything in my list of wants, but that was expected. Here is what I'd like to do with more time:
- I changed some of the traffic control actions, and that messed with my Heavy EW optimizations a bit. I'd like to redo and clean it up a bit. There are more optimizations to be made
- Handling the random traffic pattern as a separate flow would be neat, but it's unrealistic for IRL intersections.
- The code has a lot of boilerplate since I wanted separate funcs for flexibility, but there are some spots that could be combined/simplified along with other organization/cleanup work.
- Manual setup for testing traffic scenarios! A pause button, ability to set the light state, adding cars to lanes, etc.
- Right turns going when oncoming traffic is slow. I think it's fine as is for demonstration tho, and would be essentially the same as the flashing lights.
- Simulated cars.


## Running
Just put this all in a folder, and open the `index.html` file in a browser.
